# Changelog: @bsv-kit/composer

Newest first. Breaking changes come first in a release, each with its migration in one sentence.

## Unreleased

- Fixed: a pause in a hold no longer rings the phone's start tone (mw-q6n8m0.5). The recogniser is started once in a hold;
  when it ends by itself while he holds, the rest of the hold is recorded instead of the recogniser being started again,
  and on release its words follow those heard before (`startListening`'s new `transcribeRest`, by default the recording
  played into a fresh recogniser). Words that cannot be made out come back as the result's `missed` and `useHold`'s
  notice. A page that cannot record starts the recogniser again, as before.

## 0.3.0 (2026-10-15)

- Changed: the language-not-supported message now ends with the routes tried, as in '(tried: on-device en-US, cloud en-US,
  cloud default)'; an app whose tests match the whole message takes the suffix.
- Fixed: a language-not-supported no longer reaches the screen when another route can hear him (mw-hgtlf5.1). On Android
  Chrome `processLocally` is offered but never honoured: every on-device start is answered language-not-supported a moment
  later, opens no microphone and fires no end event, so a hold let go before that answer used to settle with the error and
  show it. Now such a hold settles with nothing heard. A language-not-supported walks the hold's routes, each once
  (`listenRoutes`): on-device and cloud in the page's language, then on-device en-US (asking Chrome's
  `SpeechRecognition.install` for the pack where it exists, once, for later holds) and cloud en-US, then the cloud with
  no language set; only the last route's failure is shown.
- New: after a hold that ended with a notice and no words, the bar says `tryAgain` 'Try again': a hold on it is a fresh
  one, every route untried. `useHold`'s `mode` follows the route the mic opened on.
- New: `listenRoutes`, `routeName` and the `ListenRoute` type are exported.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-10)

- New: with something attached and nothing typed, a Send arrow stands beside Hold to talk (mw-jtzpw0.9): one tap sends the
  attachments with no words (`onSend` gets `text: ''`). Hold to talk stays the big button, in the same place and the same
  height, and gives up only the arrow's width; with nothing attached the composer looks as before, and with words typed the
  text box's own Send stays. The arrow is the `bk-composer__bar-send` button, sized by `--bk-composer-bar-send-size`, named by
  the existing `send` label, and held back while the bar is held. The bar now sits in a `bk-composer__bar-row` with it.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-09)

- New: the `Composer` React component, lifted from Postern's composer (mw-jtzpw0.1): hold to talk with the words
  shown as they are heard, let go to send, slide off to keep them unsent; attach and camera quiet below the bar
  and hidden unless the app asks; 'Type a message'; `mode` 'speak' (the bar first) or 'type' (the text box and
  Send first, with a small mic); every word on the screen replaceable through `labels`; themed through
  `--bk-composer-*` CSS custom properties and `bk-composer__*` classes (`bsv-kit/composer/styles.css`).
- New: how audio becomes text is the app's `Transcriber`: `browserSpeech` (the browser's recogniser, as Postern)
  or `transcribeRecording(fn)` (the hold's recording, turned into words by the app's function on release).
- New: the parts, exported: `HoldToTalkBar`, `useHold`, `startListening`, `openBluetoothInput`, `VoiceRecorder`,
  with Postern's fixes mw-f7gmps.1 (a silent Bluetooth input gives way to the default microphone while he holds),
  mw-f7gmps.2 (no recorder holds the phone's microphone beside the recogniser) and mw-f7gmps.3 (a hold that ends
  without sending leaves its words in the box, unsent).
- Changed from Postern: the microphone-permission messages name the app from `appName` ('this app' when not
  given) where Postern's said 'Postern'.
